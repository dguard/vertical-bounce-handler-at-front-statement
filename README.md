### vertical-bounce-handler-at-front-statement

* Mr. President, we are at digitallyconstructed.ru, at knot enough far distance permitted to think that Ky\ has independent responsibility 
* But people in Mosc\ are thinking that Ukr\ is a part of their previous history. 
* That's issue. They are thinking "widely" . Based on statement-at-front we are constructing "testosteron". And started to think "widely".
* "Progress" strategy \ based on bottom-statement and pencil-from-knot. It allows to use vertical-bounce-handler and mind


* In this case we are safe from "broadcasting" between reality and past.  We may use "past" memory, it is strict. And we may use "weighted-heap" memory, it is fluent, but may be "attacked" by other people
* The strategy to save it - knot "speaking", use bottom-statement, vertical-bounce-handler and mind. 
* I am trying to keep
